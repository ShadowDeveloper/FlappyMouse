A request from u/Bedu009 on Reddit.
Modules used: keyboard, pyautogui

MAKE SURE THAT YOU RUN THIS FILE AS ADMIN!

Python is needed for this.
You are going to have to install these modules yourself!
To install modules, run `pip install keyboard` and `pip install pyautogui`.
Then run `python <PATH TO YOUR FILE?>`
